              I'm a Digital Systems and Robotics student at ITESM, currently in 5th semester.
              For the past 2 years I've been an active participant at the universities robotics team: RoBorregos.
              The opportunity of being part of the robotics team has allowed me to learn various topics like Web Development,
              Machine Learning and Robot Oriented Programming.

              One hobby that I ocassionally have is taking pictures. 
              Even thought I'm not much of a photographer, 
              I really like to capture the moment of any special time that I'm having in my life,
              just for when I see that picture I can remember the feeling that I was having in that moment.

        <h3 class="page_sub-headers">I have healthy finances</h3>
        <p> 
          For almost 8 years I have been responsible for my own finances.
          I really like to depend only on the money I own and not on another one's. 
          That's why I manage all my accounts and distribute the money for any needs 
          I may have during a period of month. Even sometimes theres an instinct that tells me that 
          I have to save more money because I may want something in the future... the weird part? 
          Most of the time it works.
