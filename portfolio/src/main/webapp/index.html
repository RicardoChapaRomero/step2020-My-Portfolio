            I'm a Digital Systems and Robotics student at ITESM, currently in 5th semester.
            For the past 2 years I've been an active participant at the universities robotics team: RoBorregos.
            The opportunity of being part of the robotis team has allowed me to learn various topics like Web Development,
            Machine Learning and Robot Oriented Programming.
