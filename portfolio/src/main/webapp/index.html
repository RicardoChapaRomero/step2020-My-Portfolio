              I'm a Digital Systems and Robotics student at ITESM, currently in 5th semester.
              For the past 2 years I've been an active participant at the universities robotics team: RoBorregos.
              The opportunity of being part of the robotis team has allowed me to learn various topics like Web Development,
              Machine Learning and Robot Oriented Programming.

              One hobby that I ocassionally have is taking pictures. 
              Even thought I'm not much of taking pictures of everything I see, 
              I really like to capture the moment of any special moment that I'm having in my life,
              just for everytime I see that picture I can remember the feeling that I was having in that moment.
